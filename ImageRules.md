When uploading images to the ELCTRONIQ repositories, it is important to follow certain guidelines to ensure that your images are uploaded successfully and can be utilized effectively. Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

Firstly, make sure that you have the necessary access privileges to the ELCTRONIQ repositories. This will ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to upload images.

Secondly, note that the maximum resolution for uploaded images is 700x700 pixels. If the image size is larger than this limit, you may resize the image using the appropriate code to ensure that it is within the specified limit.

Lastly, ensure that the webpage where the images will be displayed is within an ELCTRONIQ repository that you are currently editing unless you have been granted permission to do otherwise. This will help you to properly manage the images you've uploaded and ensure that they are being used in the correct context.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your images are uploaded successfully and can be utilized effectively. Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in the removal of uploaded images and the loss of image upload privileges.
